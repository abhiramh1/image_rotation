As per the current MVP design that I have created, the application allows the users to rotate the image (pbm in P1 format) in a specific angle that is predefined (90, 180, 270) in a clockwise or anti-clockwise manner. 

Steps for running the application: 
  Extract the src to any folder.
  Open cmd/terminal in the extracted (src) folder.
  Run the command:  python app.py
  Give the responses as requested, and the rotated image can be found under the folder rotated_images/
