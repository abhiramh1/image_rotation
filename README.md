### As per the current MVP design that I have created, the application allows the users to rotate the image (pbm in P1 format) in a specific angle that is predefined (90, 180, 270) in a clockwise or anti-clockwise manner. 

Requirements
1. `Python 3.x`

Steps for running the application: 
  1. Clone the code to any folder.
  2. Open cmd/terminal in the extracted (`src`) folder.
  3. Run the command:  `python app.py`
  4. Give the responses as requested, and the rotated image can be found under the folder `rotated_images/`
